# Command Line Software Deployments

This section collects guides that describe the deployment of software solutions in the context of Command Line Interface platforms (CLI) for bioinformatics.  
The guides are primarily aimed at infrastructure administrators and specialists, but may be useful also for those end-users that are seeking to design their own advanced deployments.  
These pages are mostly the outcome of evaluation and deployment activities that were carried out in the context of the BioCommons CLI work package.
