## About

This site presents a collection of step-by-step guides that support the reuse of Galaxy workflows created in collaboration with the Bioplatforms Australia Threatened Species Initiative (TSI). There are guides for genome assembly and quality control, RAD-seq analysis with Stacks, and more!
Other guides are available at the BioCommons [How-to Hub](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/how-to-hub), the central location for all guides and associated documents that have been prepared by community members who gather around BioCommons activities.
